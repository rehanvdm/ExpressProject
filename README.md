# Express Proejct

### Above and Beyond 
Integration or actually unit tests on the API functionality using mocha + chai. Husky has been setup to run the tests 
on the pre-push git hook

Extra npm command that runs the tests: `npm run tests`

Outstanding: 
- logging
- create /dto folder, that describes the Data Transfer Objects
- refactor validation to use jsonschema package
